About
-----
The "js-bwm" allows you to monitor the bandwidth consumption (download/upload) of your Internet link using graphics in real time, thus facilitating the visualization of how much traffic is being generated by your network.

Development
-----------
This project was developed and tested in the following environment:

- GNU/Linux 4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.x86_64 - CentOS Linux release 8.1.1911 (Core)
- PHP 7.2.11
- lighttpd/1.4.55
- jQuery 3.1.1
- Flot 0.8.3

Installation
------------
1) Move this project to the web server's root directory

2) Edit the file "stats.php" and look for the lines:

/* Monitored interface */
$iface = 'lo';

Change the content of the "$iface" variable according to the interface you want to monitor

3) Set the owner and permissions according to the user who runs the web server daemon:

* Using the user "http" as an example:
chown -R http:http <WEB DIRECTORY>/js-bwm/
find <WEB DIRECTORY>/js-bwm/ -type d -exec chmod -R 755 {} +
find <WEB DIRECTORY>/js-bwm/ -type f -exec chmod -R 644 {} +

4) Finally access the "js-bwm": http://<SERVER IP>/js-bwm/
